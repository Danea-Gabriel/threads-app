# React + Vite

Simple app like the Threads app where I used json-server as a database mock with users and threads.
My goal was to practice working with api's and practice drilling props.
The user is hardcoded so you can see only the threads from a particular user I chose and you can reply only to your own threads. The idea was to practice some basics of the React not to make an entire project.
I will comeback and implement a login part and then take all the available threads from everyone implementing the posibility to reply and like to any threads that is in you feed.

To use:

fork - > npm install -> cd database -> json-server --watch db.json -> cd .. -> npm run dev
